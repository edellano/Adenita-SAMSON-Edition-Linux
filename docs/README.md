# About Adenita:

Adenita is a 3D visualization and modeling toolkit for the in silico design of static and dynamic DNA nanostructures. Based on a multiscale data model, it visualizes DNA-based structures on different abstraction levels and enable users to load and create DNA origami structures and combine them with proteins. 

## Developers:

Adenita, currently in the alpha version, is being developed by Elisa De Llano and Haichao Miao.

## Requirements

Adenita is available for Windows and Linux. A dedicated graphics card is recommended.

## First steps

Adenita is a [SAMSON](https://www.samson-connect.net) plugin. Therefore to use it you will need to install **SAMSON 0.7.0**. Afterwards you can select Adenita from a variety of plugins. Adenita can be combined with any of them! If you are unfamiliar with SAMSON, check out their [tutorials](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/).

## Features

### Create DNA nanostructures

Use different editors to create dsDNA, nanotubes, lattices or wireframe nanostructures (uses [Daedalus](http://daedalus-dna-origami.org/) algorithm).

### Save components of your design, or the entire design

You can save the entire workspace using SAMSON's save function. If you want to save components of your design for later reuse, use Adenita's saving function (.adnpart).

### Import a DNA nanostructure from Cadnano, or load a previous design

Through the main UI you can load a Cadnano design, or component saved as .adnpart. You can combine as many components as your graphics card and CPU can afford.

### Export your design

Besides being saved, you can export your design as a list of sequences or in oxDNA format for simulations.

## Adenita UI

Once you have installed Adenita the main UI should be located with other applications:

<img src="images/adenitaUI_main.png" alt="AdenitaUI" />

Different editors can be found on the editor menu:

<img src="images/adenitaUI_editors.png" alt="AdenitaUI" />

The user can also set some options:

### Main UI

The following functions can be accessed through the main UI:

* <img src="images/load.png" alt="Load" width="25" height="25" /> Load a DNA nanostructure from a file. Possible choices are a cadnano design (for cadnano 2.5) as .json, a mesh in .ply (will be loaded using the [Daedalus](http://daedalus-dna-origami.org/) algorithm), or a .adnpart or .adn (custom Adenita formats). This option allows to load a component into a workspace (loading using SAMSON files will create a new document).
* <img src="images/saveSelection.png" alt="Save selection" width="25" height="25" />The user can chose to save a component for later use in our custom format (.adnpart).
* <img src="images/saveAll.png" alt="Save all" width="25" height="25" />The user can save all current DNA nanostructures in a .adn file, systems not handled through Adenita won't be saved.
* <img src="images/export.png" alt="Export" width="25" height="25" />Options to export as CSV sequence file or in a format appropiate for oxDNA are available here.
* <img src="images/setScaffold.png" alt="Set scaffold" width="25" height="25" />All scaffolds from the selection will be assigned a sequence specified through the 'Options' menu, scaffold nucleotide's pairs will also be assigned the complementary base.
* <img src="images/set5Prime.png" alt="Set 5'" width="25" height="25" />It is possible to set any nucleotide as the new 5' of its single strand.
* <img src="images/calculate.png" alt="Calculate" width="25" height="25" />If a path to [ntthal](https://primer3.org/) has been specified in the Options menu, it will be used to calculate the melting temperatures and Gibbs free energies of all binding regions of a selected component.

### Editors
* <img src="images/break.png" alt="Break" width="25" height="25" />Breaks the bond between two consecutive nucleotides of the same strand.
* <img src="images/delete.png" alt="Delete" width="25" height="25" />Deletes nucleotides or base pairs, depending on the chosen visualization scale.
* <img src="images/connectSS.png" alt="Connect" width="25" height="25" />Merges single or double strands. If strand ends are selected, they will be connected in the appropiate direction (5' to 3'). If nucleotides that are not 5' or 3' are selected, the strands will be broken in order to reconnect them at chosen points. It is also possible to insert a new double or single strand along the connection.
* <img src="images/merge.png" alt="Merge" width="25" height="25" />Reorganize several components into one, or reassign single and double strands to other components. List of components and strands needs to be updated manually.
* <img src="images/twistDS.png" alt="Twist double-strand" width="25" height="25" />Modifies the twist angle of a double-strand along the helical axis.
* <img src="images/tagEditor.png" alt="Tag" width="25" height="25" />Tag nucleotides or modify its base.
* <img src="images/twister.png" alt="Twister" width="25" height="25" />Remove entire the twist of a double strand locally to observe the single strands that compose it as parallel lines.
* <img src="images/dsDNAcreator.png" alt="Strand creator" width="25" height="25" />Add a new single or double strand as a component to the design. They can also be circular.
* <img src="images/latticeCreator.png" alt="Lattice creator" width="25" height="25" />Add a lattice of double strands as a component.
* <img src="images/nanotubeCreator.png" alt="Nanotube creator" width="25" height="25" />Add a nanotube composed of double strands.
* <img src="images/wireframeEditor.png" alt="Wireframe editor" width="25" height="25" />Generate a wireframe from the given shapes and add it to the design (uses the [Daedalus](http://daedalus-dna-origami.org/) algorithm).
